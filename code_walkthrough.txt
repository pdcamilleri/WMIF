Randomisation:

The order in which products/options are presented to the user needs to be randomised.
This is done in 2 parts. Firstly, at the start of the experiment, there is a 50 - 50% chance
that the order the options will be presented in will be switched (from as they appear in the
input csv file). If this is done, the two products in the state variable are switched.
At the end of the experiment they are switched back, and then written to the database,
so that the results in the database are consistent with the inputCSV file. And if the options
are swithced, a boolean variable stating so is also stored in the DB.

The second step is the result of the survey, where the participant chooses their preferred
option. These results are "unrandomised" by flipping the result of each value. So if the 
participant stated a strong value for preference 1, encoded as a value of 1 (7 being strongly
preferred the 2nd option) then the unrandomised value will be 7 and vice versa. Similarly, if their 
overall choice was for option 2, then this would be unrandomised to option 1, just before the
data is sent to the server for storage.

If the options are not randomised, then none of this occurs.

Reset the experiment

The experiment is reset by undoing all of the actions that the user performed that may 
have changed the state of the HTML document. These include moving the sliders, clicking
on radio buttons, entering text or numbers into forms, and performing actions that change
the state variable, clicking buttons to hide/show certain containers, etc.

These are all undone and the page is returned to a state equivalent to when the experiment was initially
launched.

TODO handle multiple problems when the experiment is reset
