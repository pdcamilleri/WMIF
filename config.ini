Using the three boxes below, please enter three numbers to create a credible interval around this average review score such that you are 95% confident that the true average review score is contained within the credible interval.  Remember that the true average review score includes all of the review scores that you have learned about and also others that you have not learned about. For example, imagine that your best guess of the true average review score was 50 and that you were 95% confident that the true average review score was between 30 and 70. In this case you would enter 30 as your lower estimate, you would enter 50 as your best estimate, and you would enter 70 as your upper estimate."

; perhaps have it so that variables are just single strings per problem, eg the above would become
; problem1 1111111, each 1 representing a different information format?
